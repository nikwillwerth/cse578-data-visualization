### How to run these scripts
- Clone the repository
- Open a bash script console and verify your python version is at least 3.
- Navigate to the script you'd like to run in the console
- Run the script with `python <FILE NAME (NO .PY)>

### Troubleshooting tips
- Make sure pip is installed on your machine.
- If a package is missing from your computer, use the `pip install <PACKAGE NAME>` command to install it
- If this install fails because of a permission error, run the command with `sudo` in front

### Git best practices
- Do not commit to master directly
- Commit often, with meaningful commit messages
- Create a merge request as early in the development process as possible
